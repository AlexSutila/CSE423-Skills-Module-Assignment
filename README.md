# CSE423-Skills-Module-Assignment

## Why does this exist?

As part of a class, we needed to spend roughly 8-10 hours learning a new skill that we thought might have been useful. Personally, I consider myself a die
hard C/C++ user, and I write most things in either of the two when given the chance. I definetally have more of a fascination for the lower level, and upon
hearing so much pop up about rust lately I naturally took interest. This simple project was not meant to showcase any elegant/well-written code (I could
imagine what I have here is likely neither of these as it is the first thing I set out to do on my own in rust), rather it exists for my own learning purposes
to wrap my head around the language. I also wanted to share a link to the code in the report.

## What is it?

This is just bare bones knock off of tetris, with no fancy features like score keeping or holding onto specific blocks for later.  I got to read about cargo
a bit as well and I made use of it here, so it should take care of everything regarding the dependencies. Run via the following:

```
cargo run 
```
